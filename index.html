<h1>Welcome to my Website</h1>
</center>        
<p>There is so much xenophobia on this small island. I love helping people and I recently developed a passion for creating my own
   websites, so why not do something to help my community along the way? My goal is to use this website to bring more awareness
   to this issue. You too agree with this, which is why you are here right now.

<br> <br> What is xenophobia? <br> <br
<p2> Xenophobia is the fear, dislike, or hatred of outsiders. This can manifest as hostility towards immigrants, but it 
    can also illustrate as hatred toward members of another tribe, culture, or religion.</p2>
    <br> A person does not have to come from another place or culture to become a target for xenophobia. People can 
    distrust or hate others based purely on assumptions about their accents, stereotypes, appearance and behavior.
    <br> Racism can play apart in this too, Racism is discrimination against people of different race or ethnicity. 
    Which people use as justification for xenophobia towards immigrants.Xenophobia specifically relates to a person or group 
    having 'outsider' status within a society. Racism specifically relates to race or ethnicity, whether the person or group has
     'outsider' status or not. These two forms of prejudice can occur separately, or together.
     <br>
     <br>
    For example, a born citizen of a country feeling resentful toward immigrants, solely due to a belief they are stealing local jobs,
    is an example of xenophobia on its own.

<br> <h2>Challenging Xenophobia!</h2> </p> 
</center>
On an individual level, people can challenge xenophobia via:
<ul>
<li>Education: Take time to learn about xenophobia. Educate ya self!</li>
<li>Self-awareness: It is important to become aware of one's own assumptions and to challenge them. Watch what ya say man!</li>
<li>Inclusivity: Find ways to make group environments more inclusive to break down the “us versus them” dynamic. All for one </li>
<li>Using privilege: People who belong to an in-group have privilege in comparison to perceived outsiders. Look out fa each otha</li> 
</ul>

 <p4> Here you will find links and group chats where young migrants can find websites, scholarship opportunities and informaton 
      that can posibbly help them. It is a major issue and people's minds don't tend to change easily. Regardless of this finally 
      someone is taking the innitiative to speak up and provide helpful resources for the migrants in our country, which is a big
      step in the right direction. </p4>

<h2> About Me </h2>
<p> My name is Sashae Ann Ellington and I am the founder of this non profit organization, Diverse Community Care. I am Jamaican 
    and have lived here in Antigua for six years and counting. Currently, I am enrolled at the University of West Indies Five 
    Island Campus pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Business Management. I want to have a career in the Computer science field 
    creating websites and front end developing and eventually advancing into Artificial Intelligence or Game Designing I always 
    struggled with finding fair opportunities as a migrant. There were just not enough  resources to help us migrants get around 
    and make a living in this society. I always found it unfair which is why I made this website to raise awareness and create a 
    support system so other migrants like myself will know that someone has their best interest at heart. 

    <br> <br> 
    The passion for technology was always there, it was just a bit difficult gathering the resources so the internet became my 
    friend. Then all the opportunites came avail and it was really life changing. Now I am looking to change my school and study
    Computer Science and Management instead. 
<br> <br> Thank you for visiting my website I hope you learned and gained something as well.
